# Writing Really Good Code
## Sebastian Bergmann and Arne Blankerts

> What makes up clean code? How does code turn out well? And how do you write really good code? In this workshop you will not only learn the answers to these questions. You will have the opportunity to immediately apply what you learn in a practical exercise. First, we will show how Domain-Driven Design and Test-Driven Development can be used to solve problems. Needless to say that we will cover topics such as Clean Code and SOLID along the way. Coached by the trainers, you will then work in pairs on additional features for the software we developed during the live coding. We will round up the day with a review where you will get feedback on the code you created. You will need to bring your own laptop to really benefit from this workshop. A recent version of PHP 7 and PHPUnit as well as your IDE of choice are all that is needed. No frameworks or third-party code are required.
